they find setting up. The application allows students to search for their temporary or permanent accommodation, buying and selling goods for new home,
new events happening at the university and related FAQs. Basically helps to set up everything an international student needs to start with.
Buyers and Seller students are authenticated by using university's official email id in order to avoid scams.
